## Added semantic elements to the Horiseon webpage. I wanted to ensure that the website as accessible to all audiences regardless of disabilities. 
By making changes to the css and html documents customer with accessibility tools will be able to navigate the website with no problems.
I learned that using extensions can help to see where my coding is not accessible.

##Installation
Load repo code to main branch.
